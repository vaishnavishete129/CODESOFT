This repository contains the three Python projects I developed as part of the Code Alpha Internship Program (August 2025). These beginner-friendly projects demonstrate core programming concepts like input/output, conditionals, loops, functions, and file handling.
.

üìÅ Projects Overview:
1. ‚úÖ To-Do List (CLI App)
Description: A simple command-line based To-Do List manager that allows users to add, view, complete, and delete tasks.

Features:

Save and load tasks using JSON.

Interactive menu with options.

Clean and reusable code with functions.

Concepts Used: Lists, Dictionaries, File I/O, JSON, Functions

2. üßÆ Calculator
Description: A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

User inputs two numbers and selects an operation.

Displays the result of the chosen operation.

Handles invalid inputs and division by zero.

Concepts Used: Input validation, Conditionals, Functions

3. ‚úä Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Description: A classic CLI-based game where the user plays against the computer in multiple rounds.

Features:

Random move generation for computer.

Win/tie/lose logic with score tracking.

Option to play again or exit.

Concepts Used: Loops, Random module, Conditionals, User Input

üõ† Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3.x

Tools: VS Code / Any Python IDE

Libraries: random, json (for To-Do List)
